This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc.

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind. Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't describe your whole process.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We hypothesized that a good estimator for average would be the rate at which people achieve bachelor degrees. With this in mind, we wanted to see the rates of bachelor degree attainment for different races. 

### Graphs 1 and 2: Bachelor Attainment
```{r graphs for this page, echo = FALSE}
### Graph 1 
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Years)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Male`/1000, color = 'Total Male')) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Female`/1000, color = 'Total Female')) +
  facet_wrap(~Race, scales = 'free') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 6),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6),  
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('Total Male' = 'blue', 'Total Female' = 'red')) +
  labs(color = 'Gender',
       title = "Total Number of People Who Have Attained Bachelor's Degrees",
       subtitle = "Pivoted by Race",
       y = 'Bachelors Attainment (Thousands)')

```
This graph shows the number of people that have attained bachelor's degree's pivoted by race. In general, White people attain bachelor degrees at a much higher quantity. After that, Asian and Hispanic people attain bachelor degrees at a lesser to White people, but similar rates to each other. Black women attain bachelor degrees in similar quantities to Asian and Hispanic women, but there is a distinct drop off with the quantities for Black men. 

```{r}
### Table 1b
bachelors_attainment %>% group_by(Race) %>%
  summarize(
    Male = sum(Male_P_Bach, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
    Female = sum(Female_P_Bach, na.rm = TRUE) / n()
  )
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
### Graph 2

# organizing raced percentage data
bach_prop <- acs_stuff %>% group_by(Race) %>%
  summarize(
    bach_perc_male = sum(Male_P_Bach, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
    bach_perc_female = sum(Female_P_Bach, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
    prop_m_to_f = bach_perc_female/bach_perc_male
  )

ggplot(bach_prop, aes(x = Race, y = prop_m_to_f, fill = prop_m_to_f)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Men to Females Bachelor's Degrees By Race", 
       subtitle = "Higher Proportion Means More Men than Women with Degrees",
       x = "Race", 
       y = "Preportion",
       fill = "Prop of Men to Women" ) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotate x-axis labels
        plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 2.5, "cm"))
```

Building off of Graph 1, table 1 shows that while White people attain the highest quantities of bachelor degrees, they do not have the highest rates of bachelor degree attainment. Asian people do. Looking at Asian, Black, and Hispanic people who attain bachelor degrees at similar quantities, the rate at which Asian people attain Bachelor's Degrees is around 2-3 times greater than the rate at which Hispanic or Black people achieve bachelor degrees. 

Graph 2 is just a visualization of the proportion of Male Bachelor Attainment to Female Bachelor Attainment. A darker and shorter bar means that there are proportionally more men than women getting bachelor's degrees for that race. A lighter and taller bar means the opposite: there are proportionally more women than men getting bachelor's degrees for that race.

### Graphs 3 and 4: Median Income by Degree

    Difference = Bach_M_Median - Bach_F_Median
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Years, names_to = "Type", values_to = "Amount")

data2_grad <- acs_income %>% na.omit() %>%

  summarize(

    Grad_F_Median = sum(Grad_F_Median) / n(),
    Difference = Grad_M_Median - Grad_F_Median
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Years, names_to = "Type", values_to = "Amount")

ggplot(data2_bach, aes(x = Years, y = Amount, color = Type)) +
  geom_line(stat = "identity") +
  ylim(0, 80000) +
  labs(title = "Bachelor Median Salary by Gender",
       subtitle = "Salaries in 2022 Inflation-Adjusted US Dollars",

                    name = "Gender",
                    labels = c("Difference" = "Difference",
                               "Bach_M_Median" = "Male",
                               "Bach_F_Median" = "Female"))
### Graph 4
ggplot(data2_grad, aes(x = Years, y = Amount, color = Type)) +
  geom_line(stat = "identity") +
  ylim(0, 100000) +
  labs(title = "Graduate Median Salary by Gender",
       subtitle = "Salaries in 2022 Inflation-Adjusted US Dollars",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Median Salary") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Difference" = "green", 
                               "Grad_M_Median" = "blue", 
                               "Grad_F_Median" = "red"),
                    name = "Gender",
                    labels = c("Difference" = "Difference",
                               "Grad_M_Median" = "Male",
                               "Grad_F_Median" = "Female"))
```
Graphs three and four show median gendered salary for People with Bachelor's Degrees and Graduate Degrees respectively. In both cases there is a significant difference between Male and Female salaries. Interestingly the quantity of the pay gap has remained the same, but because of inflation this gap has become a slightly smaller percent difference.

Looking at these graphs, it is clear to see the data in general follows a linear trend. We have decided to initially use a VAR model to study our data. Our hope is to see if gendering the average median income is statistically significant. 

## Modeling

### Model 1: VAR of Average Median Income

```{r Statistical Models}
###Summarize Income data
acs_income_mean <- acs_income |>
 dplyr::select(Years, Bach_M_Median, Bach_F_Median, Median_Bach)|>
  group_by(Years)|>
  summarise(
    `Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)` = mean(Bach_M_Median),
    `Average Median Income Bachelors (Female)` = mean(Bach_F_Median),
    `Average Median Income Bachelors` = mean(Median_Bach, na.rm = T)
  )
```

```{r model_1}
### model 1 (VAR) of AVG. Median Income

model1 <- VAR(acs_income_mean[, -1], p = 1)

tidied <- broom::tidy(model1)

table1 <- tidied |>
  filter(group == 'Average.Median.Income.Bachelors') 

knitr::kable(table1)
```

When you regress the gendered average median income for people who have achieved bachelors against the Total Average Median Income (TAMI) for the same group, there are no significant p-values. The smallest p-value of the female data is at p = .099 implying that given the TAMI, there is about a 10% chance to get a set of statistics that is as far or further away from the TAMI given that there is no correlation between Average Female Median Income and TAMI.

### Model 2: ARIMA of Gendered Average Median Income
```{r model_2}

ar1 <- arima(acs_income_mean$`Average Median Income Bachelors`, order = c(1,1,1))

ar1_t <- broom::tidy(ar1)

ar2 <- arima(acs_income_mean$`Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)`, order = c(1,1,1))

ar2_t <- broom::tidy(ar2)

ar3 <- arima(acs_income_mean$`Average Median Income Bachelors (Female)`, order = c(1,1,1)) 

ar3_t <- broom::tidy(ar3)

combined_table <- bind_rows(
  ar1_t %>% mutate(variable = "Average Median Income Bachelors"),
  ar2_t %>% mutate(variable = "Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)"),
  ar3_t %>% mutate(variable = "Average Median Income Bachelors (Female)")
) |> filter(term == 'ar1')
  

# Print the combined table
knitr::kable(combined_table)
```
In this ARIMA model, we took the 15 years of income data from the ACS and used it to predict the future change in income. The ar1 estimators basically show how much the a given year's income data is affected by the prior year's income data. Because all three (combined, male, and female) data have similar coefficients (all within a range of ±.03), we can assume that our variables all share similar levels of autocorrelation. This means they have similar momentum in time, which implies that the pay gap between men and women is relatively unchanged as both men and women receive similar changes in rates. 

This makes sense with the first model, because the pay gap has remained relatively the same, it is hard to show that just being female makes a significant change Average Median Income. This supports the conclusions we came to from our third and fourth graphs.

Because just gendering the data was not statistically significant, we decided to see if separating by both gender and race gives us more significant changes.

### Graph 5

```{r}
dofl <- read_csv(here::here('dataset/dofl_income_clean.csv'))

dofl_prep <- dofl|>
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = 'Race', values_to = 'Income') |>
  mutate(Gender = str_replace(str_replace(str_extract(Race, "Men|Women"), "Men", "Male"), "Women", "Female"))

ggplot(data = dofl_prep, aes(x = Year, y = Income, color = Race)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Years", y = "Income", color = "Race") +
  theme_minimal()
### Above is a line graph of income data for each race and gender


## merging attainment data with income
dofl_merge <- dofl_prep |>
  mutate(Race = str_replace_all(Race, c(" Men" = "", " Women" = ""))) |>
  filter(Year >= 2015) |>
  filter(Race != 'Total') |>
  arrange(Race) |>
  arrange(Gender)

desired_races <- c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "White, non-Hispanic", "Asian")

bachelor_merge <- bachelors_attainment |>
  mutate(Race = str_replace_all(Race, c(" Alone" = '', "not Hispanic"= 'non-Hispanic',' or Latino' = '', ' alone' = '', ' Origin' = ''))) |>
  filter(Race %in% desired_races) |>
  group_by(Race, Years)|>
  summarise(`Percent Male` =mean(Male_P_Bach, na.rm = T),
            `Percent Female` = mean(Female_P_Bach, na.rm = T)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Percent Male", "Percent Female"), 
               names_to = "Gender",
               values_to = "Bachelors Attainment") |>
  mutate(Gender = str_replace_all(Gender, c('Percent ' = ''))) |>
  arrange(Race) |>
  arrange(Gender)

modeling_data <- dofl_merge |>
  mutate(Bachelors_Attainment = bachelor_merge$`Bachelors Attainment`)

ggplot(data = modeling_data, aes(x = Income/1000, y = Bachelors_Attainment, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Race, scales = 'free') + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Income (in thousands)", 
       y = "Rate of Bachelor's Attainment",
       color = "Gender",
       title = "Relationship Between Income, Bachelor's Attainment, and Gender Across Races")
```
This graph shoes how both bachelor attainment and gender affects income. It is clear to see the distinction between males and Females in this data for every racial group. Every race except Asian people have similar relationships between income, bachelor's attainment, and gender. In general, especially with white people, it looks like males go to college less while they get paid more. The opposite seems to be true for Asian people. Asian males tend to go to college more and get paid more, while females Males tend to go to college less and get paid less. In general, the groups themselves (grouped by both Race and Gender) follow a mostly linear trend. This data appears to be suitable for linear regression.

### Model 3: Linear Regression
```{r}
modeling_data$Bachelors_Attainment <- scale(modeling_data$Bachelors_Attainment)
modeling_data$Race <- factor(modeling_data$Race, 
                             levels = c("Black", "Hispanic","White", 
                                        "White, non-Hispanic", "Asian"))

glm_model <- glm(Income ~ Race + Gender + Bachelors_Attainment, 
                 data = modeling_data, family = gaussian())

tidy_summary <- broom::tidy(glm_model)
tidy_summary



glm_model2 <- glm(Income ~ Race + Gender, 
                  data = modeling_data, family = gaussian())

tidy2summary <- broom::tidy(glm_model2)
tidy2summary
```
Here we made two different linear models. The first shows the affects of Race, Gender, and Bachelors Attainment on Income. From this data we see that all of the predictor variables are statistically significant. However the most interesting predictor variables are gender and  bachelor.

The second show the affects Race and Gender only (without Bachelors Attainment) on Income. We can see once again that all of the predictor variables are still statistically significant. The most interesting change is with Asians.
