This comes from the file `analysis.qmd`.

We describe here our detailed data analysis. This page will provide an overview of what questions you addressed, illustrations of relevant aspects of the data with tables and figures, and a statistical model that attempts to answer part of the question. You'll also reflect on next steps and further analysis.

The audience for this page is someone like your class mates, so you can expect that they have some level of statistical and quantitative sophistication and understand ideas like linear and logistic regression, coefficients, confidence intervals, overfitting, etc.

While the exact number of figures and tables will vary and depend on your analysis, you should target around 5 to 6. An overly long analysis could lead to losing points. If you want you can link back to your blog posts or create separate pages with more details.

The style of this paper should aim to be that of an academic paper. I don't expect this to be of publication quality but you should keep that aim in mind. Avoid using "we" too frequently, for example "We also found that ...". Describe your methodology and your findings but don't describe your whole process.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We hypothesized that a good estimator for average would be the rate at which people achieve bachelor degrees. With this in mind, we wanted to see the rates of bachelor degree attainment for different races. 

### Graph 1


```{r graphs for this page, echo = FALSE}
### Graph 1 
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Years)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Male`/1000, color = 'Total Male')) +
  geom_line(aes(y = `Total Female`/1000, color = 'Total Female')) +
  facet_wrap(~Race, scales = 'free') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(size = 6),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6),  
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c('Total Male' = 'blue', 'Total Female' = 'red')) +
  labs(color = 'Gender',
       title = "Total Number of People Who Have Attained Bachelor's Degrees",
       subtitle = "Pivoted by Race",
       y = 'Bachelors Attainment (Thousands)')

```
This graph shows the number of people that have attained bachelor's degree's pivoted by race. In general, White people attain bachelor degrees at a much higher quantity. After that, Asian and Hispanic people attain bachelor degrees at a lesser to White people, but similar rates to each other. Black women attain bachelor degrees in similar quantities to Asian and Hispanic women, but there is a distinct drop off with the quantities for Black men. 

```{r message = F}
### Table 1b
bachelors_attainment %>% group_by(Race) %>%
  summarize(
    Male = sum(Male_P_Bach, na.rm = TRUE) / n(),
    Female = sum(Female_P_Bach, na.rm = TRUE) / n()
  )
```
Building off of Graph 1, while White people attain the highest quantities of bachelor degrees, they do not have the highest rates of bachelor degree attainment. Asian people do. Looking at Asian, Black, and Hispanic people who attain bachelor degrees at similar quantities, the rate at which Asian people attain Bachelor's Degrees is around 2-3 times greater than the rate at which Hispanic or Black people achieve bachelor degrees.

```{r Statistical Models}
###Summarize Income data
acs_income_mean <- acs_income |>
 dplyr::select(Years, Bach_M_Median, Bach_F_Median, Median_Bach)|>
  group_by(Years)|>
  summarise(
    `Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)` = mean(Bach_M_Median),
    `Average Median Income Bachelors (Female)` = mean(Bach_F_Median),
    `Average Median Income Bachelors` = mean(Median_Bach, na.rm = T)
  )

### Graph 5
### preliminary model of income data checking (first need to see distribution)
ggplot(data = acs_income_mean, aes(x = Years)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Average Median Income Bachelors`, color = "total")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = `Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)`, color = 'male')) +

                                'male' = 'blue', 
                                'female' = 'red')) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

looking at this graph, it is clear to see the data in general follows a linear trend. We have decided to use a VAR model to see if genderingÂ the average median income is statistically significant. We can also see that the changes in each group by year are consistent

## Modeling

#### Model 1: VAR of Average Median Income

```{r model_1 , message = F}
### model 1 (VAR) of AVG. Median Income

model1 <- VAR(acs_income_mean[, -1], p = 1)

tidied <- broom::tidy(model1)

table1 <- tidied |>
  filter(group == 'Average.Median.Income.Bachelors') 

knitr::kable(table1)
```

When you regress the gendered average median income for people who have achieved bachelors against the Total Average Median Income (TAMI) for the same group, there are no significant p-values. The smallest p-value of the female data is at p = .099 implying that given the TAMI, there is about a 10% chance to get a set of statistics that is as far or further away from the TAMI given that there is no correlation between Average Female Median Income and TAMI.

```{r model_2 , message = F}
### model 2 ARIMA of each individual variable

ar1 <- arima(acs_income_mean$`Average Median Income Bachelors`, order = c(1,1,1))

ar1_t <- broom::tidy(ar1)

ar2 <- arima(acs_income_mean$`Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)`, order = c(1,1,1))

ar2_t <- broom::tidy(ar2)

ar3 <- arima(acs_income_mean$`Average Median Income Bachelors (Female)`, order = c(1,1,1)) 

ar3_t <- broom::tidy(ar3)

combined_table <- bind_rows(
  ar1_t %>% mutate(variable = "Average Median Income Bachelors"),
  ar2_t %>% mutate(variable = "Average Median Income Bachelors (Male)"),
  ar3_t %>% mutate(variable = "Average Median Income Bachelors (Female)")
) |> filter(term == 'ar1')
  

# Print the combined table
knitr::kable(combined_table)
```

This is the set of the auto regressive coefficients of each of these variables analysed through a time series model. We can find that their coefficients are extremely similar, implying that our variables all share similar levels of autocorrelation, leading them to all have similar momentum, which implies that the pay gap between men and women is relatively unchanged

With these two models we basically see that the income gap. Although women are getting paid more, so are men, and their pay increases are at similar rates.

```{r , message=FALSE}
bachelors_attainment <- read_csv(here::here('dataset/ACS_Gender_and_Race.csv'))

bachelors_attainment$Male_P_Bach <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", bachelors_attainment$Male_P_Bach)) / 100

bachelors_attainment$Female_P_Bach <- as.numeric(gsub("%", "", bachelors_attainment$Female_P_Bach)) / 100

dofl <- read_csv(here::here('dataset/dofl_income_clean.csv'))

dofl_prep <- dofl|>
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = 'Race', values_to = 'Income') |>
  mutate(Gender = str_replace(str_replace(str_extract(Race, "Men|Women"), "Men", "Male"), "Women", "Female"))

ggplot(data = dofl_prep, aes(x = Year, y = Income, color = Race)) +

            `Percent Female` = mean(Female_P_Bach, na.rm = T)) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Percent Male", "Percent Female"), 
               names_to = "Gender",
               values_to = "Bachelors Attainment") |>
  mutate(Gender = str_replace_all(Gender, c('Percent ' = ''))) |>
  arrange(Race) |>
  arrange(Gender)

modeling_data <- dofl_merge |>
  mutate(Bachelors_Attainment = bachelor_merge$`Bachelors Attainment`)

ggplot(data = modeling_data, aes(x = Income/1000, y = Bachelors_Attainment, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Race, scales = 'free') + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Income (in thousands)", 
       y = "Proportion Bachelor's Attainment",
       color = "Gender",
       title = "Relationship Between Income, Bachelor's Attainment, and Gender Across Races")

### As can be seen in the graphs above, it is clear to see the distinction between males and Females in this data for every racial group. Males tend to go to college less and get paid more, but the groups themselves follow a mostly linear trend. This data appears to be suitable for linear regression.
```

```{r message=FALSE}
modeling_data$Bachelors_Attainment <- scale(modeling_data$Bachelors_Attainment)
modeling_data$Income <- scale(modeling_data$Income)

glm_model <- glm(Income ~ Race + Gender + Bachelors_Attainment, 
                 data = modeling_data, family = gaussian())

tidy_summary <- broom::tidy(glm_model)
tidy_summary

glm_model2 <- glm(Income ~ Race + Gender, 
                  data = modeling_data, family = gaussian())

tidy2summary <- broom::tidy(glm_model2)
tidy2summary
```
Here we made two different linear models. The first shows the affects of Race, Gender, and Bachelors Attainment on Income. From this data we see that all of the predictor variables are statistically significant. However the most interesting predictor variables are gender and  bachelor.

The second show the affects Race and Gender only (without Bachelors Attainment) on Income. We can see once again that all of the predictor variables are still statistically significant. The most interesting change is with Asians.
