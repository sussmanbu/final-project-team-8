He finds joy in using knowledge to enhance lives and processes. Economics is his playground, and he is an overenthusiastic problem-crusher. When not decoding economic mysteries, he is on a book binge or catching up with friends and family.\n\nIn the economics arena, he is heads over heels for macroeconomics. Reading financial crisis books is a passion, giving him a lowdown on economic rollercoasters. Beyond that, he kicks a ball around, and travel to broaden his perspectives.\n\n## Tianxiang Chen\n\nTianxiang is a graduate student major in MA Economics.\n\n## Gabe Gan\n\nGabe is a senior student majoring in Applied Mathematics.\n\n<!-- Please leave in the information below -->\n\n### About this Template.\n\nThis is based off of the standard Quarto website template from RStudio (2023.09.0 Build 463).\n",
