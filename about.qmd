Bhimraj is a sophomore pursuing a dual degree program in B.A. in Economics and Mathematics and M.A. in Economics. He finds joy in using knowledge to enhance lives and processes. Economics is his playground, and he is an overenthusiastic problem-crusher. When not decoding economic mysteries, he is on a book binge or catching up with friends and family.

In the economics arena, he is heads over heels for macroeconomics. Reading financial crisis books is a passion, giving him a lowdown on economic rollercoasters. Beyond that, he kicks a ball around, and travel to broaden his perspectives.

## Tianxiang Chen

Tianxiang is a graduate student major in MA Economics.

## Gabe Gan

Gabe is a senior student majoring in Applied Mathematics.
