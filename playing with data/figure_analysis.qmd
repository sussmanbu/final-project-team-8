### starting to consider what figures to create

```{r Importing Cleaned Datasets and Tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
Emp_wb = read_csv('dataset/World_Bank_Employment_Data.csv', show_col_types = F)
Educ_wb = read_csv('dataset/World_Bank_Educ_Data.csv', show_col_types = F)

```

```{r Creating Potential Plots}
Emp_wb$Year <- as.Date(as.character(Emp_wb$Year), format = "%Y") 

```

```{r trying to make a map based on census data}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidycensus))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(sf))

v2020 <- load_variables(2020, "acs5", cache = TRUE)

concepts <- v2020 |>
  filter(str_detect(concept, '^MEDIAN INCOME'))

### Would like to analyze B19326_004 and B19326_005 (They were a dud, most likely skewed due to part-time workers)

### Looking at C24040_002 and C24040_029 now which are
##SEX BY INDUSTRY FOR THE FULL-TIME, YEAR-ROUND CIVILIAN EMPLOYED POPULATION 16 YEARS AND OVER for male and female


vars_df <- v2020 |>
  filter(name == 'C24040_002' | name == 'C24040_029') |>
  mutate(
    variable = name,
    gender = if_else(
      str_detect(label, 'Male'),
      'Male',
      'Female'
    ),
    .keep = 'none'
  )

gendered_employment <- get_acs(
  geography = 'state',
  variables = vars_df |> pull(variable),
  year = 2020,
  geometry = TRUE
) |> 
  left_join(vars_df) |>
  select(-moe, -variable, -GEOID, -NAME) 

gendered_employment_split <- gendered_employment |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = 'gender', values_from = 'estimate')
  

total_employment <- gendered_employment |>
  group_by(geometry) |>
  summarise(total = sum(estimate))

gendered_employment_final <- st_join(gendered_employment, total_employment, join = st_equals)
```

```{r heatmap idea for median working population}
gendered_employment_split |>
  ggplot(aes(fill =  `Male`/`Female`)) + 
  geom_sf() +
  coord_sf(crs = 5070) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = 'plasma')+
  theme_minimal()

### this creates two maps, which are representative of the proportion of full time, year round civillians in each state faceted by gender. I'm not sure if this is the best approach to data presentation, and I am open to other ideas
