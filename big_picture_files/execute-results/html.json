This project examines America's educational landscape, and examines how race and gender affect educational opportunities in the United States. Our goal is to expose inequalities, address challenges and spark conversations to transcend statistics to heal the gender-racial education divide in the country.\n\nThe project confronts the stark disparities within and between gender and racial groups. A canvas of educational attainment paints a picture of untapped potential, begging the question: who truly wins the race to success?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](big_picture_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Charting Educational Journies\n\nThe project begins by mapping the educational voyage of women and men across the fifty states and Puerto Rico. The project then dissects the percentage of women that has attained a bachelor's degree or higher, faceted by race. Through a lens of seven years, from 2015 - 2022, we project the percentage of women that has attained a bachelor's degree of higher for the next five years. Yet, the journey does not end there; the project mirrors this process for men, dissecting the educational diversity with equal rigor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Illuminating the Gender Pay Gap\n\nAlso guided by the beacon of economic insight, the project delves into income data of genders and races spanning sixty two years. The income data by the U.S. Department of Labor is more than statistics; they embody the struggle for equity. With each statistical model, this project sheds light on the pay gap differences between men and women, and between races.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: package 'knitr' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Source: Cleaned Dept. of Labor Data](bigpic_medianincome/graph_median_income.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Gender and Race Dynamics Above the Poverty Line\n\nThis project also investigates the amount of females and males above the poverty line across U.S. states and sees the differences for different gender and races. The disparities are particularly seen for Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Alone, Black Alone, and most notably, American Indian and Alaska Native Alone populations. These findings further highlight the systemic injustices that contribute to inequality within communities. To visualize this data, we created an interactable Shiny App that can be accessed [Here](https://dylonth.shinyapps.io/final/).\n\n## Using Statistical Techniques to Analyze Disparity\n\nThis project uses a variety of statistical techniques to try to answer\n\nThis project uses a variety of statistical techniques to try to answer questions pertaining to gender, education and race. This caused us to reach the following conclusions:\n\n  - Income disparities can be seen across genders and races, with Hispanic men and women earning significantly less than their White counterparts. Hispanic men also fare better compared to Hispanic women. \n  \n- Overall, the disparity that women receive facing income does not appear to be changing.\n\n\nThis project stands on the crossroads of data and destiny. Join us as we continue this quest for a more egalitarian society, one insight at a time.\n",
