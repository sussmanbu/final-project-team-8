The purpose of this blog post is to highlight three potential data sets that our group may focus on for our final project.

## Data Set One: Death rates for suicide by race, age, and Hispanic origin in the United States

  This data set was gathered from data.gov, a free database provided by the U.S. Government (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-hispanic-origin-and-age-united-states-020c1). This data set has 6390 objects and 13 columns, and describes U.S. suicide rates from the years 1950 to 2018. Data before 1980 is a decade apart (1950, 1960, 1970, 1980) but yearly after 1980.
  There is a large variety of groups that this data set is separated by, including aggregate data, gender, race, and age.
