# **Unveiling the Racial Education Divide: Women vs. Men in Every State - Who Wins the Race to Success?**

By Team 8

In the pursuit of success, education is a key element, but what happens if the path of education is not equal to all? This project examines America's educational landscape, and examines how race and gender affect educational opportunities in the United States. Our goal is to expose inequalities, address challenges and spark conversations to transcend statistics to heal the gender-racial education divide in the country.

Exploration starts by mapping out the educational voyage of women and men across the fifty states and Puerto Rico.

Things to include:

Intro: Hook, common ground, intervention.

1.  Educational attainment- percentage of women bachelor's degree of higher across US states, faceted by race . Aim, to group said percentages into across 50 states for 12 years. Make a linear model to project what they can be. Then, do the same for men.
    1.  After we can compare the differences of projection (gaps maybe) within women and races

    2.  Also compares each women-race pair with men-race pair for projections on educatoinal attainment levels (specifically percentage of bachelor's degree of higher)

        (All to answer – who wins the race to success)
2.  Project will also include comparisons of men and women workforce across states (glimpse - background) using heatmaps (simplify what heatmap means to readers)
3.  Driven by a passion of Economics, since authors are mostly economists, can't resist the temptation for pay-gap analysis using income data from the Department of Labor for each men-race and women-race pair across the years from 1960 up to 2022. Also will develop linear regression model for this for each men-race, and women-race pair
4.  Ensuring all process are done efficiently methods , repeatble , etc.

Note: simplify how we say linear regression. The results are not yet done (so include paragraph parts on where you could put results)

This comes from the file `big_picture.Rmd`.

Think of this page as your 538/Upshot style article. This means that you should try to tell a story through the data and your analysis. Read articles from those sites and similar sites to get a feeling for what they are like. Try to write in the style of a news or popular article. Importantly, this pge should be geared towards the general public. You shouldn't assume the reader understands how to interpret a linear regression. Focus on interpretation and visualizations.

## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Title
    -   Your big picture page should have a creative/click-bait-y title/headline that provides a hint about your thesis.
-   Clarity of Explanation
    -   You should have a clear thesis/goal for this page. What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don't go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.
    -   Each figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.
-   Creativity
    -   Do your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.
-   This page should be self-contained.

**Note**: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use `#| echo: FALSE`.

## Rubric: Other components

### Interactive

You will also be required to make an interactive dashboard like [this one](/flex/flex.html).

Your Big Data page should include a link to an interactive dashboard. The dashboard should be created either using Shiny or FlexDashboard (or another tool with professor's approval). This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.

-   Quality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture? Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!

### Video Recording

Make a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components. You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.

### Rest of the Site

Finally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.

The main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template.
